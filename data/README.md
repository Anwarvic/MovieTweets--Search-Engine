# Data Preparation

Reading this file is optional and you can use the data without knowing how I got it. But if you want more information about how I got it, then reading this document will be suitable.

The data used in this repo is a data that contains reviews on IMDb movies on Twitter. The data is a csv file containing:

- `movie_id`: the Id of the movie on IMDb.
- `movie_name`: the name of the movie as shown on IMDb.
- `tweet_id`: the tweet id on Twitter.
- `tweet_text`: the tweet text.
- `tweet_tone`: the tone of the tweet.
